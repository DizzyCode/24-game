# 24-game

### Objective
The objective of the 24 Game is to use four given numbers and the common operations (+, -, \*, /) to make 24. This program finds possible combinations of getting 24 when the 4 numbers are provided.

### Details
* After running `24_game.py` in the command line, follow prompts to enter your four numbers separated by commas
* Only integers are accepted, or program will prompt you to re-enter them correctly
* An unordered list of all the solutions will appear, and also a count
* Some solutions not identical but are mathematically equivalent (remember those properties?)
* After each round, you have the option to enter four new number or quit

### Disclaimers
I consulted many sites as I worked on 24-game, including (but not limited to) Stack Overflow and GitHub. 24-game is only intended as a casual project, so please don't sue me :(

Since this is my first actual python project, I am aware that the code is ugly and may not seem "pythonic." Feel free to leave suggestions or bash it however you want.

### Info
*Version 0.1* (I guess?)
